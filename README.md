# Sonar_mine_detection
Given a dataset of sonar data, a model is created which predicts if an unknown object is a Mine or Rock.
We have 60 features (independent variables) and 1 target variable (M or R).
Logistic Regression is used for classification.
Finally, a GridSearchCV is also applied for tuning the Logistic Regression model parameters.
